### Description: 
A basic implementation of the only game that might stop the end of the world if we get there. Currently, it is set up for 2 players. No computer interraction. The next steps for me are to re-watch the Joshua implementation and redesign the interface. This implementation is created in linux, if you have other methods for execution that works for you let me know.

### Installation:
Linux

    git clone https://github.com/konijntjesbroek/tictactoe.git
    cd <path to executables>
    ln -s <clone path>/tictactoe.py . && chmod 755 tictactoe.py 
    head -1 tictactoe.py && which python3
        double check the shebang points to your nnstallation of python

### Execution:
    tictactoe.py
